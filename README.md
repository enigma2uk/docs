# Enigma2 DVB-S Guide (UK Specific)

The UK centric guide to using the various Satellite (DVB-S) TV set-top boxes than utilise the open source [Enigma2](https://www.enigma2.net/) platform!

There doesn't appear to be much information on acquiring, installing and configuring Enigma2 boxes on the web, especially for the UK market, which is dominated by state-maintained Freesat or commercial operations such as Sky TV and Virgin Media.

We intend to cover all the basics from choosing a suitable LNB replacement and suitable hardware tuners plus maybe some custom plugin development along the way.

Please note that although much of the information provided here with probably work with a Terrestrial/Aerial (DVB-T) based configuration, we will be mainly focussing on Satellite (DVB-S) setups.
