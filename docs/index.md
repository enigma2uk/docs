## Satellite Dish, LNB and Cabling

So, you probably have an old unused satellite dish from a previous Sky installation or from the previous owner/tenant, and you'd like to make use of it to receive some free OTA (over-the-air) television?

Do you have one of those minidishes, the non-circular Sky ones? Chances are this is a [Mk4 Sky Minidish](https://www.amazon.co.uk/MK4-Dish-Kitd-Quad-Zone/dp/B00OYUJVM0). These dishes are fine for receiving all satellite broadcasts available in the UK. However, the [LNB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-noise_block_downconverter) (the gun on the stick) can make all the difference between what equipment you can use to receive those satellite signals, and how many simultaenous programmes you can watch, record or stream. Your existing cabling is probably fine, so at the very worst, you might need to buy a ~Â£40 replacement LNB and a ladder!
